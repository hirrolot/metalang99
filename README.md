TODO: the main example (https://github.com/Hirrolot/macrolop/issues/1).

Macrolop allows you to create and use embedded [domain-specific languages] in pure C.

Everything you see happens at compile-time. Everything you need is `#include <macrolop.h>` and a C99 preprocessor.

[domain-specific languages]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language
